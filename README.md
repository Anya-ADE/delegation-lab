Lab #4: Event Delegation, closest(), and matches()

CMPS2212 Lab #4, focuses on mastering Event Delegation, a design pattern where a single event listener is placed on a 
parent element to manage events for all current and future child elements. 
By using event.target, closest(), and matches(), you will create leaner, more maintainable UI code
